# vulkage

This project was setup by following the [mesh shading implementation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0JVLUVCkk-l7CWCn3-cdftR0oajugYvd) streaming via Arseny Kapoukine

Now mostly follow the **bgfx** style with my own rough understanding to do the abstraction.

It is a playground to understand modern graphics programming better.

----------

#### Depends

- volk
- meshoptimizer
- tracy
- glfw
- imgui
- bx
- bimg
- bgfx_common
- glm
- premake5

----------

#### niagara part(The streaming by Arseny Kapoukine):

Supports:

- mesh-shading
- task-submission
- Lod
- mesh level occlusion
- meshlet level occlusion
- frustum culling
- back-face culling

-----------

#### vulkage part:

`` leash the vulkan in cage ``

- frame graph
  - sort and clip unnecessary passes and resources based on the contribution to the final result.
  - auto barrier: intend to record the resource state and transform states and layouts atomically.
  - auto alias: alias transition buffers if their lifetime is not overlapped. (Note: images are not been processed yet because a more specific condition required)

- gfx api abstraction
  - vulkan
- profiling
  - based on Tracy
- render command system
  - allow store the command then translate to platform API (e.g. vulkan)

- nanite style dynamic meshlet lod selection
- deferred rendering
- gltf scene loading
- bindless texture
- SMAA
- geometry shader based voxelization（with oct-tree optimized）
- radiance cascade(WIP)

------------

#### Build and Run:

1. download [premake5](https://premake.github.io/download/) and install it first.

2. clone the repo via:

   `git clone https://github.com/teassy000/vulkage.git`
   
3. enter the root directory by: 

   `cd vulkage`
   
4. update sub-modules via : 

   `git submodule update --init --recursive`
   
5. generate project with command: 

   `premake5 vs2022 x64`

   you can find the solution file in `./build/vulkage.sln`

Note: METIS lib should be compiled manually.

Working dir: `./`

`project_root$> vulkage.exe [model_dir] [-p]`

`[-p]` : Force parse the model. The project will parse the model file once and dump the medium data to reduce loading time. 

Note2: The project tested with vs2022 and worked on Nvidia 3070+ serials card. And it used the vulkan extension: `VK_EXT_mesh_shader`, default vertex pipeline might not work due to no testing for it.
